## Inspiration
Christmas shopping is difficult, and has only gotten more difficult in 2020. People are living away from their families and friends. They are also working within a limited budget and it is important to keep track of your expenditures to spend it wisely while also ensuring your family receives the best gifts. Doing allocation and figure out gifts takes time, and doing it with your Christmas playlist plays in the background can only motivate!

## What it does

## How I built it
I followed tutorials on using Android Studio. Then I came across something called Flutter. I immediately got down to installing all the necessary softwares. I spent a day just watching videos and scrolling through websites to get a hang of the code, since I am only experiences in python. The next day I started following along tutorials.

## Challenges I ran into
Working solo is a challenge of its own, there is no one to brainstorm with. You have to do all the tasks, starting from ideation, design thinking, ppt making, app development and submission. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Working solo is also the biggest accomplishment. You have 100% ownership of the project submitted, and you become great at debuging your own code.

## What I learned
Android app development was something I wanted to get into for quite sometime. I am glad I finally got my hands dirty thanks to the Holiday Hacks hackathon. The perils and advantages of working solo were also something I learnt.

## What's next for Christmas Clutter
